How to play
-----------
First and foremost, Dance of Bullets is a bullet-hell shmup, and while that can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, here the most important things to know are:

- It's much more important to dodge the bullets than to shoot enemies. Focus on your ship and the bullets around you, and not the enemies flying by!
- You'll see a small blue dot on the "windshield" of your ship. That's the only part you need to protect. Bullets will just fly through other parts!
- If you get hit, use your few seconds of invincibility to get to a safer spot!
- Observe the patterns – flying through a seemingly unavoidable bullet cloud is the most satisfying feeling this genre can offer!


With that, these are the controls:
---------------------------------
Arrow keys to move
C or Space to shoot (just keep pressing it, you have no reason to let it go!)
X to turn your "slow down" ability on or off – use it to get through tight spots! Turns off when the blue bar is completely drained.
Z or Y to unleash "rain of bullets" (only when the green bar is full, and then it stays enabled 'till it's drained) – use it when you need a final blow on a nasty boss. Not only does it increase your fire rate, but also wipes all bullets off the screen.
P to pause
Esc to Exit

How to play in a window?
------------------------
Open Config.xaml in your favorite text editor and change the full screen setting to "False". You can also change the resolution (effectively, the size of the window once you disabled full screen) there.

That's a bit more difficult than it should be, sorry for that.

Help! This game is very hard!
-----------------------------
The current prototype is meant to showcase the variety of bullet patterns the engine / level format can produce, and I'm aware it doesn't really have what you could call a smooth difficulty curve!

I kept some of the debug functions in the prototype build, which should make playing the game easier when you need it. Some examples (but you may discover others!):

Press S to make the game slower (and F to make it faster). Use Shift + S / Shift + F to accelerate the process.
Press H to heal yourself and fill your power-up bars. Think of it as inserting another coin, though beware that this can't resurrect you once you are dead.
Press N to kill everything on screen and skip the current level completely.
